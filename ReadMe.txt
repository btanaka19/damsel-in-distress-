When I originally started making the game, the idea was for it to be a game that devalued violence and promoted talking to “enemies”. While I did accomplish this, the effect is heavily diminished by the nature of inform. The fact that I tried this in a text based game, which has almost no combat, makes the effect feel much weaker. In this respect the game does not actually accomplish what I wanted to. One of the bigger problems I had was when I was trying to make the code to make sandwiches. I was having problems getting the npc to acknowledge that the player was interacting with them. I solved it by looking at other games to figure out how I should word the code and I fixed other problems by Changing starting locations of objects. The first puzzle is a person puzzle where you need to befriend a guard in order to get him to let you out of the cell. You solve the puzzle by asking him about his favorite sandwich. The second puzzle is another person puzzle where you need to bribe the guard in order to get a key. You solve it by giving ingredients for a sandwich to the chef in order to get the sandwich needed to bribe the guard. The third puzzle is yet another person puzzle. You need to bribe or kill the demon lord in order to leave and win. You solve it by getting an ingredient from an npc then giving the ingredient to the chef in order to get the sandwich needed to bribe the demon lord. I had my parents and Calien beta test. The feedback I got was helpful as I was able to catch several grammar errors. From a gameplay perspective, the beta test didn’t change much. It did lead to me creating several new conversations and descriptions, but not much in terms of actual gameplay. 
I beta tested Calien’s game. The feedback I gave was mostly on grammar, but there were several puzzles i feel I helped to improve. I’m most proud of the chef npc, as his code took the most time to complete. Next time I would probably make different puzzles. I kind of want to incorporate codes into the puzzles. In general I feel like I chose a bad scenario to work with so I want to make one that fits the platform better next time.
